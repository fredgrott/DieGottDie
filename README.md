Sort of a play on English and German to symbolize that to step among greats 
you have to kill some 'gods'.

Sort port of Jake Wharton's U2020 and LemonLabs u2020Mortar demo apps, 
meant to demo some best practices of Dagger, Mortar, and Flow and 
some best practices in using Retrofit, Madge, Rx, and some other 
things.

The kill the 'gods' part is we use POJOs, one activity, and views 
and  the MVP pattern to come up with an alternative to going down the
broken nested fragments path and fragments in general on the 
android platform.

# Differences versus u2020Mortar

The main differences is that the debug menu will be implemented differently
as we do not have a navigational drawer in the main application. The second difference
is that implementing a way to use annootations and some other things to bring the 
ability to offer different layouts for both phones and tablets.

# Credits

Thanks goes to Square and LemonLabs whose stuff I have built upon here with this demo application.

# Job and project Work Inquiries 

I only talk to founders, and usually that is over a paid meal at my location.
